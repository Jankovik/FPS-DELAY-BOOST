Use these to test for better performance, some PCs prefer having the standard setting of "NormalPriority"
and some MUCH prefer High.

You can try any and all of these by simply clicking on the Reg and pressing "ok",
this will then be applied next time you boot your game, see how it performs and if its good, keep it, if it stutters?
Just apply the "normal priority" key again to revert it!
